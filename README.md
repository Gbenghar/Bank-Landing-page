## My process
- Created the necessary folders and files to be used.
- Started with the header component which includes; the home-logo, hamburger for the mobile view, the menu tabs and button for the desktop view. They were being hidden in different view modes with the help of creating a media query to handle. hide-for-mobile and hide-for-desktop and making them to display and hide by viewport.
- I proceeded to adding functionality to the hamburger menu button and other "clicks" with JavaScript.
- I worked on ensuring proper display of different aspect o the web page with different screen-sizes by ensuring optimum responsiveness using mixins in SCSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I learnt other intriguing uses of SCSS markup


### Useful resources
